# On-Chain Dynamic NFTs with SVG Storage

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to create and store dynamic non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The NFTs are stored on-chain using SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) images. The project utilizes the ERC1967Proxy contract to enable upgradability of the NFT contract.

## Overview

This project is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- Foundry: A development framework for Ethereum smart contracts
- OpenZeppelin Contracts: A library of reusable and secure smart contract components
- ERC1967Proxy: A contract that enables upgradability of the NFT contract
- SVG: A format for storing and displaying vector graphics

## Features

- On-chain storage of NFTs using SVG images
- Dynamic NFTs that can be updated and changed
- Upgradability of the NFT contract using ERC1967Proxy
- Secure and reusable smart contract components using OpenZeppelin Contracts

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-project-name.git`
2. Install dependencies: `forge install`
3. Compile the contracts: `forge build`
4. Deploy the contracts: `forge script deploy`

## Usage

Once the contracts are deployed, you can interact with them using the provided scripts. Here are a few examples:

- Mint a new NFT: `forge script mintNft`
- Update an existing NFT: `forge script updateNft`
- Get the token URI of an NFT: `forge script getTokenURI`
